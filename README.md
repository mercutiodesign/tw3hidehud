# tw3hidehud
Autohotkey Script to hide the Witcher 3 HUD.

Performs the keyboard input that result in a hidden HUD or restore the default HUD.
Press F4 while in game and not paused.

If the game is not loading the pause menu fast enough this script might load an older save game so make sure you quicksave before using the shortcut. If this problem occurs more often you can increase the keypress delay.
